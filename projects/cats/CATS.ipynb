    "Implement `report_progress`, which is called every time the user finishes typing a word. It takes a list of the words `typed`, a list of the words in the `prompt`, the user's `user_id`, and a `send` function that is used to send a progress report to the multiplayer server. Note that there will never be more words in `typed` than in `prompt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your progress is a ratio of the words in the `prompt` that you have typed correctly, up to the first incorrect word, divided by the number of `prompt` words. For example, this example has a progress of `0.25`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "report_progress([\"Hello\", \"ths\", \"is\"], [\"Hello\", \"this\", \"is\", \"wrong\"], ...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Your `report_progress` function should return this number. Before that, it should send a message to the multiplayer server that is a two-element dictionary containing the keys `'id'` and `'progress'`. The `user_id` is passed into `report_progress` from the GUI. The progress is the fraction you compute. Call `send` on this dictionary to send it to the multiplayer server.\n",
